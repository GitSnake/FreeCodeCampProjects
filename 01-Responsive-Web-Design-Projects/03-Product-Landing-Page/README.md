# Responsive Web Design Projects - "Build a Product Landing Page"
Objective: Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/RKRbwL.
## Requirements: Use vanilla HTML, JavaScript, and CSS to complete this project

1. The product landing page should have a header element with a corresponding id="header"
1. Include an image within the header element with a corresponding id="header-img". A company logo would make a good image here
1. Within the #header element I can see a nav element with a corresponding id="nav-bar"
1. At least three clickable elements inside the nav element are visiable, each with the class="nav-link"
1. Include active links When I click a .nav-link button in the nav element, I am taken to the corresponding section of the landing page.
1. Embed a product video with id="video"
1. Include a form element with a corresponding id="form"
1. Within the form, include an input field with id="email" where I can enter an email address
1. The #email input field should have placeholder text to let the user know what the field is for
1. The #email input field uses HTML5 validation to confirm that the entered text is an email address
1. Within the form, there is a submit input with a corresponding id="submit"
1. When I click the #submit element, the email is submitted to a static page (use this mock URL: https://www.freecodecamp.com/email-submit) that confirms the email address was entered and that it posted successfully
1. The navbar should always be at the top of the viewport
1. The page should have at least one media query
1. The page should utilize CSS flexbox at least once
